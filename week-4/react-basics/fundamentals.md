## React
### 3 Core things needed to understand React 
* **State** - A javascript object that represents the current state of the app. Anything that changes in your website in your state.
**Ex** - Counters, values etc.  
* **Component** - Shows how a DOM element should render, given a state. It is a re-usable, dynamic, HTML snippet that changes given the state. 
* **Re-rendering** - A state change causes a re-render. 
  

You write code in .jsx files -> Javascript + XML tags. 
Can write it in .js also but .jsx is the norm for react files.
